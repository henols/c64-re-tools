# Roadmap: c64-re-tools

## Milestones

- ✅ **v0.2.0 Switchable stock-VICE backend** — Phases 1-8, 8.1, 8.2 (shipped 2026-08-19)
- ✅ **v0.3.0 regenerator2000 static-analysis backend** — Phases 9-11, 11.1 (shipped 2026-08-21)

## Phases

<details>
<summary>✅ v0.2.0 Switchable stock-VICE backend (Phases 1-8, 8.1, 8.2) — SHIPPED 2026-08-19</summary>

**Delivered:** a second, project-selectable backend that drives stock upstream
VICE through its binary monitor — so a user with an apt-installed VICE can run
the six shipped skills, and is told plainly where they must reach for the fork
instead. The stock manifest ships **38** tools against the fork's 62; the gap is
documented rather than hidden.

- [x] Phase 1: Corrected Ground Truth (4/4 plans) — completed 2026-08-12
- [x] Phase 2: Stock Backend Connection (10/10 plans) — completed 2026-08-13
- [x] Phase 3: Direct Tools (18/18 plans) — completed 2026-08-16
- [x] Phase 4: Client-Side Tool Seam and 6510 Disassembler (7/7 plans) — completed 2026-08-17
- [x] Phase 5: Skill-Critical Derived Tools (13/13 plans) — completed 2026-08-17
- [~] Phase 6: Stock-Only Gains — **CUT** 2026-08-17 (no skill calls any of them)
- [x] Phase 7: Cycle Timing and Wedge Triage (18/18 plans) — completed 2026-08-18
- [x] Phase 8: Capability Honesty and the Install Story (6/6 plans) — completed 2026-08-18
- [x] Phase 8.1: Close v0.2.0 audit items (INSERTED) (5/5 plans) — completed 2026-08-19
- [x] Phase 8.2: Close v0.2.0 blockers (INSERTED) (6/6 plans) — completed 2026-08-19

**Shipped and archived 2026-08-19:** 9 phases, 87 plans, 218 tasks, 51/51
in-scope requirements, 8 days. Final audit round 4 — `tech_debt`, no blockers.

<details>
<summary>✅ v0.3.0 regenerator2000 static-analysis backend (Phases 9-11, 11.1) — SHIPPED 2026-08-21</summary>

**Delivered:** recon findings stop being prose. regenerator2000 is adopted as a
static-analysis backend — a persistent, queryable annotation store plus a
recursive-descent disassembler — reached through **17** curated `r2000_*` tools
and a `vice-mcp r2000 <verb>` CLI, entirely container-side and structurally
incapable of touching VICE. Register writes read as bit names, symbols flow both
ways between the store and a live emulator, and the flat linear `toacme` decoder
it makes obsolete is deleted.

- [x] Phase 9: The Assumption Probe (Go/No-Go) (8/8 plans) — completed 2026-08-20 — verdict `degrade` (rule `R4`), see `docs/phase9-regenerator2000-probe-findings.md`
- [x] Phase 10: Adoption Boundaries, Automated Bootstrap, and the Removal (9/9 plans) — completed 2026-08-20
- [x] Phase 11: Annotation Store, Enums, and the Symbol Round Trip (12/12 plans) — completed 2026-08-21
- [x] Phase 11.1: Close v0.3.0 Audit Items (INSERTED) (7/7 plans) — completed 2026-08-21

**Shipped and archived 2026-08-21:** 4 phases, 36 plans, 101 tasks, 12/12
in-scope requirements, 3 days. Final audit round 2 — `passed`, zero open gaps.

criteria and the close-time milestone summary:** [`milestones/v0.3.0-ROADMAP.md`](milestones/v0.3.0-ROADMAP.md)

### 📋 Next milestone (not yet opened)

Run `/gsd-new-milestone` — questioning → research → requirements → roadmap.
Phase numbering continues from 11.1; the next phase is **12**. Numbers are never
reused, including the dissolved ones.

## Progress

| Phase | Milestone | Plans Complete | Status | Completed |
|-------|-----------|----------------|--------|-----------|
| 1. Corrected Ground Truth | v0.2.0 | 4/4 | Complete | 2026-08-12 |

| 5. Skill-Critical Derived Tools | v0.2.0 | 13/13 | Complete | 2026-08-17 |
| 6. Stock-Only Gains | v0.2.0 | — | **Cut** 2026-08-17 | - |
| 7. Cycle Timing and Wedge Triage | v0.2.0 | 18/18 | Complete | 2026-08-18 |
| 8. Capability Honesty and the Install Story | v0.2.0 | 6/6 | Complete | 2026-08-18 |

| 8.2 Close v0.2.0 blockers (INSERTED) | v0.2.0 | 6/6 | Complete | 2026-08-19 |
| 9. The Assumption Probe (Go/No-Go) | v0.3.0 | 8/8 | Complete | 2026-08-20 |
| 10. Adoption Boundaries, Automated Bootstrap, and the Removal | v0.3.0 | 9/9 | Complete    | 2026-08-20 |
| 11. Annotation Store, Enums, and the Symbol Round Trip | v0.3.0 | 12/12 | Complete    | 2026-08-21 |
| 11.1 Close v0.3.0 Audit Items (INSERTED) | v0.3.0 | 7/7 | Complete   | 2026-08-21 |

**v0.2.0 final state:** 9 phases, 87 plans, 51/51 in-scope requirements satisfied.
17 requirements were cut wholesale on 2026-08-17 and remain in
`milestones/v0.2.0-REQUIREMENTS.md` marked `CUT` with rationale, so restoring one
is a scope decision rather than an archaeology exercise. Known deferred items at
close: 13 (see `STATE.md` → Deferred Items).

**v0.3.0 final state:** 4 phases, 36 plans, 101 tasks, 12/12 in-scope
requirements satisfied. 4 of the original 16 `R2000-*` requirements were cut or
folded on 2026-08-17 and remain in `milestones/v0.3.0-REQUIREMENTS.md` with
rationale. `R2000-16` was satisfied with criterion 3(4) scoring `partial`,
which fired decision rule `R4` and narrowed the shipped input set to
`.prg`/`.d64`/flat-64K (D-34) — the probe was honoured, not overridden. Known
deferred items at close: 19 — 18 pending todos plus Phase 03's UAT gap (see
`STATE.md` → Deferred Items, derived from `.planning/todos/pending/` and guarded
in both directions).
